## Welcome to My GitHub Page

Welcome to my website! I though this would be an interesting experiment to do, it took a little while to setup but it worked out! I created this using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)And since the repository is hosted on GitHub, I can edit it from anywhere and commit(publish it) from anywhere! My contact information is below if you want to contact me for anything I prefer Discord if you would like to message me.
