## Welcome to My GitHub Page

Welcome to my website! I though this would be an interesting experiment to do, it took a little while to setup but it worked out! My contact information is below if you want to contact me for anything I prefer Discord if you would like to message me. I also like to sleep in so don't be surprised if I don't answer immediately, I will try to contact you back as soon as I can.
