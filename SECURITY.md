# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are
currently being supported with security updates.

I only develop the latest version, any versions before this are not supported. Please try to use the most recent code I have released.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can message me on discord to report a vulnerability. Tell me about it and I will try to fix it, any suggestions would be helpful. The more information the better.
