## how I created this website

I host a local reposotory of my makeshift server(an old 2014 Macbook Air running linux mint) I use GitKraken as my git editor becuase of it's nice gui interface. The files can be edited and commited on it.

### Other things I do with my "server"

I use it to host a few other web servers. I monitor it with [NetData](https://netdata.cloud) which I have found to be very useful and fairly easy to setup.
